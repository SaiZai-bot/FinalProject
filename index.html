                <h1 class="headingC">CRANE TRUCK</h1>
                <p> A crane truck is a versatile piece of heavy machinery that integrates a robust lifting crane with the mobility of a truck. 
                    This combination allows it to transport heavy materials and equipment over long distances and then lift them to significant heights with precision. 
                    Crane trucks are commonly used in construction, logistics, and infrastructure projects where flexibility and efficiency in moving and placing heavy loads are essential. 
                    Their ability to navigate urban environments and rough terrains makes them indispensable for tasks ranging from building construction to utility maintenance. </p>

                <h1 class="headingE">EXCAVATOR</h1>
                <p> An excavator is a powerful piece of construction equipment characterized by its rotating platform, long arm, and bucket. 
                    This design allows it to perform a variety of tasks, including digging, trenching, and material handling. 
                    Excavators come in different sizes, suited for tasks ranging from small-scale landscaping to large-scale mining operations. 
                    Their versatility is further enhanced by the ability to swap attachments, such as augers, breakers, and grapples, making them adaptable to different job requirements. 
                    Excavators are essential in construction, demolition, and earthmoving due to their precision and efficiency. </p>

                <h1 class="headingH">HAUL TRUCK</h1>
                <p> A haul truck, also known as a dump truck, is engineered for transporting large quantities of materials across construction sites, mines, and quarries. 
                    These trucks are designed with a durable frame and a large payload capacity, allowing them to carry heavy loads of earth, ore, and debris efficiently. Haul trucks are equipped with powerful engines and robust suspension systems to handle rough terrains and steep gradients. 
                    Their ability to transport bulk materials over long distances is crucial for large-scale construction and mining operations, making them a vital component in the logistics of heavy material movement. </p>
