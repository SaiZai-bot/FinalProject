            <h1>Haul truck</h1>
            <p>
                A haul truck is a heavy-duty vehicle engineered for 
                transporting immense quantities of materials such as 
                rocks, soil, and ore over rough terrain, predominantly 
                utilized in mining and large-scale construction projects. 
                These trucks are built to handle extremely heavy loads, 
                often exceeding hundreds of tons, and are equipped with powerful engines and 
                robust suspension systems to navigate the challenging environments of 
                quarries and mining sites efficiently.

            <h1>Crane truck</h1>
            <p>
                A crane truck integrates the transport capabilities 
                of a truck with the lifting power of a crane, making 
                it a versatile tool for lifting, moving, and placing 
                heavy objects with precision. This vehicle is essential for 
                construction, industrial, and infrastructure projects, 
                where it can be quickly positioned to lift heavy loads such as 
                steel beams, machinery, and building materials, providing 
                both mobility and efficiency on job sites.

            <h1>Excavator</h1>
            <p>
                An excavator is a versatile and powerful 
                piece of construction equipment featuring a 
                long arm with a bucket at the end, used for digging, 
                trenching, and material handling. Commonly seen on 
                construction and demolition sites, excavators are 
                crucial for tasks such as foundation digging, 
                earthmoving, and debris removal. Their ability to 
                rotate 360 degrees allows for excellent maneuverability 
                in tight spaces, making them indispensable for a 
                wide range of construction activities.

            <h1>Cement Truck</h1>
           <p>
            A cement truck, also known as a concrete mixer, 
            is designed to transport and mix concrete to 
            ensure it remains in a workable state until it
            reaches the construction site. The truck features a 
            rotating drum that continuously mixes the concrete 
            ingredients, preventing them from hardening during 
            transit. This vehicle is vital for delivering ready-mixed concrete 
            to various construction projects, ensuring a consistent and reliable 
            supply of this essential building material.

            <h1>Loader Truck</h1>
            <p>
                A loader is a versatile construction machine equipped 
                with a large front-mounted bucket used for scooping, 
                lifting, and transporting materials like dirt, gravel, 
                and sand. Loaders are commonly used in construction, 
                landscaping, and agricultural applications for tasks 
                such as loading materials onto trucks, clearing debris, and 
                leveling ground surfaces. Their ability to quickly move large 
                quantities of 
                material makes them a crucial asset in various earthmoving and 
                material-handling operations.

            <h1>Bulldozer Truck</h1>
            <p>
                A bulldozer is a robust tracked vehicle with 
                a large, flat blade mounted at the front, used 
                for pushing earth, debris, and other materials. 
                It is essential for land clearing, road building, 
                and heavy-duty construction tasks. Bulldozers are 
                known for their immense power and durability, 
                allowing them to perform demanding tasks such as 
                grading, excavation, and demolition. Their tracks 
                provide excellent traction on rough terrain, making 
                them ideal for use in challenging environments.
